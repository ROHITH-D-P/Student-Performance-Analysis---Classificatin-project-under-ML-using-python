  • • • STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS • • •


🚀 Project Overview:

  I recently completed a classification-based project focused on analyzing student performance. The goal was to evaluate various models to predict student outcomes effectively. The models used include:

   ✔️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   ✔️ Logistic Regression
   ✔️ Decision Tree Classifier
   ✔️ Random Forest Classifier
   ✔️ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🔍 Key Features:

🔹Comparative analysis of different classification algorithms.
🔹Evaluation based on accuracy, classification report.
🔹Insights into factors affecting student performance.


📈 Outcome:

   The project provided a comprehensive comparison of model performance, helping identify the most effective algorithm for predicting student outcomes. Key findings included Accuracy and Classification reports.


🔧 Technologies Used:

   ✔️ Python
   ✔️ Scikit-Learn
   ✔️ Pandas
   ✔️ Matplotlib & Seaborn


💡 Learning Experience:

  This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and comparative analysis. It also deepened my understanding of various classification techniques and their applications in educational data analysis.
